Blackjack is my favorite card game. 

This blackjack rule is like a casino. 

A computer automatically calculates your card and if it is over 21, you automatically lose the game. 

Computer will get a card until cards count more than 16. 

The program is smart enough to decide whether A should count as 1 or 11. 

10, J, Q, K all count as 10, But J < Q < K. 

The cards presented during the game will not appear again unless the deck holds less than programmed numbers.
