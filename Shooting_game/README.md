This game is inspired by Buster Bros Air Force and The Binding of Isaac. 

The old_shooting_game file is like Buster Bros. A 

character moves at the bottom of stage only, and balls bounce, too. 

The new_shooting_game file is more like The Binding of Isaac. 

I made this thinking of how freely Isaac moved around the map and attacked the enemy. 

The character can move all 4 sides of the game screen. But, only when character 

is on the brick stage. 

The object of this game is to remove all balls on the screen within a limited time. 

The character also comes with lives so that a user can easily beat the game. 

Use arrow key to move around and space key to shoot weapons.
