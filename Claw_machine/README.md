claw game This game is inspired by a claw machine that I used to play to get some toys at the shopping mall. 
The game is simple and fun. 
Press space key to stop and the claw will stretch out to a beautiful doll. 
The object of this game is to get more score than a goal score within limited time. 
Each dollâ€™s value differs by character.
