 

This is a memory game. 

Here is a rule. 

Once you click the start button on the screen, please memorize numbers in ascending order.  

There is a time limit until numbers are going to be hidden. 

The time limit varies by level. 

As the level goes up time limit will be tighter and there will be more number to memorize. 

Once numbers get hidden, the number sign will disappear.  

Click the lowest number holding circle to the highest in order.
